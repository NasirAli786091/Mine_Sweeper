# Mine_Sweeper
a command line game - minesweeper using Python language by a beginner
since I am a beginner so it might be useful to those who are new and need some help
the only drawback is that in that code -----> print('--------------------------') line
it does not depend on dimenions so if the default dimension size which is 8*8 gets changed to 9 it wont print but i will change it later
